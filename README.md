## 💬 Notes

POE is built to assist with clarity, consistency, and structured flexibility, especially when navigating high context communication or tight professional standards.

It is particularly useful for neurodivergent users, high load multitaskers, and those new to LinkedIn-style writing.  POE also works equally well for content strategists, personal branding efforts, and anyone developing high-visibility updates.
